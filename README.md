# ðŸ›’ E-commerce Customer Data Analysis

## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement

In todayâ€™s digital marketplace, understanding how customers interact with an e-commerce platform is vital for optimizing sales and improving user experience. This project aims to analyze customer data from an e-commerce website to uncover trends in spending behavior, time spent on the website vs. app, email provider usage, and regional differences. By using data analytics and visualization techniques, the goal is to draw actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, platform development, and business growth.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior across different platforms (website vs. mobile app).
- Identify the most and least valuable customers based on time and spending.
- Discover regional (state-wise) differences in customer behavior.
- Understand how email providers and address locations correlate with customer activity.
- Use statistical measures to assess variations in customer engagement and spending.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- *Source:* Internal e-commerce customer records
- *Format:* CSV file (manually loaded)
- *Features Include:*
  - Email, Address, Avatar (customer details)
  - Time on Website, Time on App
  - Yearly Amount Spent (target variable)
  - Derived fields: State, Email Provider, Total Time

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

- *Python* â€“ Core language for data analysis
- *Pandas* â€“ Data manipulation and cleaning
- *NumPy* â€“ Numerical analysis
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* â€“ Data visualization
- *Scikit-learn* â€“ Preprocessing and regression (optional extension)

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Customers spending more time on the *app* tend to have *higher yearly spending*.
- Certain *states* consistently have higher customer engagement and spending.
- *Email providers* can show interesting usage patterns but have minor impact on spending.
- Derived metrics like *Total Time* provide a more comprehensive view of user engagement.
- Visualization tools like *heatmaps, boxplots, and histograms* highlight variability across features.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- *Heatmap* of correlations between numeric features
- *Boxplots* to detect outliers in time and spending
- *Histograms* with KDE curves to understand distributions
- *State-wise group analysis* for average behavior
- *Coefficient of variation* for comparing behavioral diversity across states

---

## âœ… Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates the importance of app engagement in predicting customer value and reveals meaningful behavioral patterns across states and user segments. These insights can help e-commerce platforms improve personalization, streamline user experience, and enhance marketing campaigns.

## ðŸ”® Future Work

- Train regression models to predict yearly spending from user features.
- Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on behavior.
- Integrate geographic visualizations using external APIs for deeper location insights.
- Explore time-based trends if timestamps are available in the dataset.
